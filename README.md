# The longest string without repetition

Please notice that in this repository I have provided 2 implementation of the function. 

The first implementation is using immutable data structure.

The second implementation is using mutable data structure.
The second implementation is faster than the first one. Usage of mutable data structure is correct as the reference for the mutable data structure does not leave the scope of the function.
